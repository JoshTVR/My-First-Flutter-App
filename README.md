# My First Flutter App

Welcome to my first Flutter project! ðŸš€  
This repository is part of my journey to learn Flutter and Dart through an online course. Here youâ€™ll find my code, notes, and experiments as I progress.

## About

This project is a collection of lessons, practice apps, and exercises following the [Flutter course](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab).
The main goal is to get hands-on experience with Flutter for building beautiful, cross-platform apps for Android and iOS.

## Features

- Flutter basics and setup
- Widgets and layouts
- Navigation and routing
- State management
- Networking and API calls
- Custom themes and UI

## Getting Started

To run this project locally:

1. [Install Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JoshTVR/My-First-Flutter-App.git
   ```

## Progress update

This is how it looks right now, I've finished the [Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab) from Flutter Docs.

This isnâ€™t the end of this repository! I still want to build something original using everything Iâ€™ve learned so far. For now, though, this is a savepoint.
